*Description*: The increasing number of hotel cancellations calls for a Machine Learning based solution that can help in predicting which booking is likely to be canceled. A chain of hotels in Portugal are facing problems with the high number of booking cancellations and have reached out to me for data-driven solutions. I have analyzed the data provided to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, built a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and helped in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.
